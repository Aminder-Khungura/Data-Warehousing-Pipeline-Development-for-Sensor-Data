The American Heart Association notes that a normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) for adults. Medical experts also agree that a lower resting heart rate can indicate more efficient heart function and cardiovascular fitness, as highly conditioned athletes typically have a resting heart rate of 40 to 60 bpm.
Body temperature is an independent determinant of heart rate, causing an increase of approximately 10 beats per minute per degree centigrade. Body temperature is also an independent determinant of respiratory rate. This quantification may help in the assessment of the hot and unwell child, to determine whether any tachycardia or tachypnoea is caused solely by fever, or whether there may be an element of concurrent shock.
